# PROBLEM STATEMENT

only a few restaurants have the order and deliver service and most of these restaurants that people like do not have the order and deliver service. So, in the current system the customercalls and places an order and come eat at the restaurant or come pick up the order for him orherself and sometimes in this situation orders may take long to be processed especially whenit is a busy day and most customers may be annoyed by waiting or even lose their appetitewhich may lead to cancellation of orders and a loss. Things are done manually which leads tolong $ueues and food processing taking a long time sometimes because most of the things aredone manually customers who call in cannot really view the menu and sometimes it isdifficult to explain some of the food items to the customers.
